## A Mini Theme for Coloured Channels in Discord!
Just save [ColouredChannels.theme.css](https://hoyupu.github.io/ColouredChannels/ColouredChannels.theme.css) to your themes folder, it should work with any theme!<br>
It supports up to 50 channels listed at the same time. If you need more, you could open an issue here.<br>
<sub> * Only tested with BetterDiscord, please let me know if it fails on something else and I'll look at it when I can! </sub><br>
